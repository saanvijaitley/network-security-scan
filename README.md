# Local Network Port Scan Project
My first network scanning project using Nmap. This includes a SYN scan, analysis of open ports and services, and identification of security risks.

This project showcases a network scan of my local network using Nmap,an open-source network scanning tool.The goal was to discover devices, identify open ports, understand services running on those ports, and evaluate potential security risks.

Project Files
- scan_results.html
  An HTMLformatted version of the raw Nmap scan results showing open ports and services on devices within the local network.
- scan_report.html
  An HTMLformatted detailed report analyzing the scan results, common services on detected ports, and potential security implications.

 Tools Used
- Nmap: For scanning the network to identify live hosts and open ports.
- Notepad: To prepare and convert reports to HTML.
- GitHub: For version control and project hosting.

Scan Details

- Network Range Scanned: `192.168.1.0/24`
- Scan Type: TCP SYN Scan (`nmap -sS`)
- Output Format: Saved as text and converted to HTML for easy viewing.

what I learned-
- How to perform network scans using Nmap.
- How to interpret open ports and identify common services.
- Understanding potential security risks related to exposed ports.
- Basic usage of GitHub for hosting and sharing project files.
  
USAGE of this-
Open the html files in any modern web browser to view the scan results and the report with formatting and styling for better readability.
